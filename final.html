								<b>Analyzing Venezuela's food shortage crisis and its impacts</b>
							</h3>
							<hr size=3>
							<p>
								Venezuelan non-profit <i>Code for Venezuela</i> has compiled a detailed dataset recording the diets of tens of thousands of Venezuelan households. This information can be used to analyze the health and food security level of the Venezuelan people in the midst of the ongoing economic collapse and food crisis. In this article, I will provide a data-driven perspective on this humanitarian crisis.

					<h6><b>Author: Reid Thompson</b></h6>
					<p>Half a century ago, Venezuela was an economic powerhouse in the making. With more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, a newly democratic government, and a plethora of foriegn investments supporting its growing infrastructure, Venezuela was once considered to be a country brimming with oil and opportunity. Today, though, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1235189/household-poverty-rate-venezuela/" target="_blank">over ninety percent of Venezuela’s population</a> is below the poverty line, and the country’s economic state has been compared to the Great Depression, but worse. </p>
					<p>Venezuela's current economic slump can be attributed to a variety of factors, but namely almost a century of oil dependency, authoritarian misamanagement, and rampant embezzlement. After the discovery of oil in Venezuela in the 1920s, the country’s economy quickly grew dependent on the export, shedding almost every other facet of its economy in order to fully capitalize on the extraction of this prized natural resource. By the 1970s, when oil was at its most valuable, Venezuela was well on its way to becoming the most powerful nation in South America. As a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela dominated the world’s oil market. This fortune did not last, though, as the following decades brought lower oil prices and political turmoil.</p>
					<p>As public discontent grew, Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez of the Venezuelan military ran for president on a socialist platform in the late 1990s, promising to turn around the country’s declining economy and oil extraction. After taking power, Chavez focused on social reforms and drastic government power-grabs, eventually doing away with democratic processes altogether in favor of a more authoritarian style of government.</p>
					<p>By the early 2010s, plummeting oil prices sank the Venezuelan oil-based economy into a deeper depression, and political unrest weakened the country’s despotic government. Today, Chavez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, struggles to retain his legitimacy, repressing political opposition and giving aid only to those who support him while the majority of the country struggles to pay for basic expenses. Decades of economic uncertainty and political violence have escalated Venezuela’s issue into a full-scale humanitarian crisis, causing thousands of refugees to flee the country every year. In a situation as complicated as this, it is difficult to quantify just how the population of Venezuela has been impacted, and what factors may play a role in individual prosperity or poverty.</p>
					<p>In an attempt to answer this question, Venezuelan nonprofit <a href="https://www.codeforvenezuela.org/" target="_blank"><i>Code for Venezuela</i></a> has <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/open_daily_food" target="_blank">collected information on tens of thousands of households,</a> gathering data on financial status, diet, and education in order to get a comprehensive picture of each household. This data can be extremely valuable when it comes to identifying Venezuela’s most vulnerable demographics, which in turn can be used to identify which groups need the most humanitarian assistance. Major population divisions such as economic status, geographic location, and education can be analyzed in order to find trends in poverty levels, which is the first step on the way to creating a solution. Geographic divisions in particular have produced some noticeable trends, with clear economic disparities between rural, suburban, and urban populations.</p>

					<p>When visualizing Code for Venezuela’s geographic data, some obvious patterns emerge. Notably, almost half of the rural Venezuelan households polled could only afford food, compared to only one third of urban households. 26% of rural Venezuelan households could not afford food at all, while 15% of city-dwellers were in the same financial situation. These trends indicate a far higher level of poverty in Venezuela’s rural areas, where resources are in shortest supply.</p>
					<p>Rural Venezuelans are feeling the full effect of the country’s economic struggles for several reasons. In an attempt to minimize price-gouging, Venezuela’s government regulates maximum prices on certain foods, but according to the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/24/venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis/severe-medical-and-food-shortages-inadequate-and" target="_blank">Humanitarian Rights Watch,</a> these affordable meals quickly run out in rural areas, forcing citizens to search for food in better-stocked urban stores. Another reason for rural Venezuela’s economic hardship is its heavy reliance on agriculture, which has largely been seized by the state since the government’s rise in authoritarian leadership. The government's expropriation of much of the nation's farmland has crippled the industry, leaving rural areas that were once reliant on agriculture devoid of both food and income. </p>
					<p>This level of extreme poverty manifests itself in a variety of long-term health conditions, including chronic malnutrition. Dietician and assistant professor Jane Burrell has studied nutrition for much of her career, and in her work she recognizes that chronic malnutrition has health detriments that run far deeper than weight loss. According to Burrell, when a child suffers chronic malnutrition it “...affects their intellectual development, their learning ability, their ability to fight infection, their whole immune system will be compromised which means that they’re more susceptible to infectious disease and death before age five.”</p>
					<p>In a recent survey conducted by several Venezuelan universities, the average Venezuelan lost an average of nineteen pounds in 2016 alone. For Burrell, this issue is not a temporary health crisis, but a generational one.  “...we’re going to have a whole generation that has lost potential for getting through school and earning a living, and so we’re going to see generations of cyclical poverty,” said Burrell.</p>

					<p>In order to numerically articulate the level of widespread malnutrition in Venezuela, <i>Code for Venezuela</i> used two diet ranking systems, the <i>Househould Dietary Diversity Index</i> (HDDI), and the <i>Food Consumption Score</i> (FCS). These scores take into account the variety of food groups consumed as well as the level of caloric intake over a period of time in order to give a household a score. In Burrell's words, "These scores are based on typically some kind of food frequency which asks how often you consume foods in categories that serve as sort of a proxy for nutrients. So if we look at the overall score, it could tell us the quality of the diet." </p>

					<p>Using these data visualizations as a reference, the impacts of Venezuela's food shortage appear to vary depending on geographic location. Rural Venezuelans appear to make up the majority of low-scoring households on both the HDDS and the FCS index, while Venezuela's urban and suburban population make up the higher-scorers. 

					In a <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20180523_acaps_thematic_report_humanitarian_crisis_in_venezuela.pdf" target="_blank">2018 report</a> by the international non-profit Assessment Capacities Project, or ACAPS, announced that Venezuela's crisis was difficult to address largely due to a lack of information: "Due to a significant lack of data it is unclear how humanitarian needs vary across the country, both by severity and geographic distribution, particularly urban-rural." With this data now available, it may prove invaluable in such a multi-faceted crisis, providing clear target demographics that require immediate aid. </p>
